 Source maps are used so that the debugging become the easier and our development become easier.

 2. if we download any project from the github then there should be no any node modules folder in it so we have to made it first , so for that we have to  run a command 
 
 npm i or npm install.


 after that when we run 000     npm run build then it will run
 yeh kehta hai babel ka CLI tools jo ki node module me hai.---->> se ki script.js ko lelo  aur lib folder me dal do



befor that whem we are using the cdn link of babel it bydefault using the souce-maps
 3. using two ways we can create the source maps
     1. we have to add  
 --source-maps in the build of package.json 
after that when we run 

    npm run build 
    
then it will create a file in the lib folder named script.js.maps
 and in the script.js file it add a comment named like----

//# sourceMappingURL=script.js.map


     2. in the .babelrc we have to add a key value pair named
     "sourceMaps":true

     after that when we run the npm build command it will generate a script.js.maps file in lib and also a comment in the script.js file in last
